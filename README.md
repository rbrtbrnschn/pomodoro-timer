# Pomodoro Timer
Sends a notification every 25 minutes, gives you a **5 mine** break, and starts all over again.
## TODO

* [ ] create readme

* [ ] use screen for process management

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rbrtbrnschn/pomodoro-timer.git
cd pomodoro-timer
./install.sh
```

## Usage
```
pomodoro &
```

> Using the "&" after is vital at this point, so you can continue using your terminal session, keeping the timer in the background.

> This project was conceived to 'Nothing actually, for once.'
